# Summary of decisions on database part
I am working on the database part and I am going to set up postgreSQL database on Azure, as it is the require cloud platform. For now I am just going to make a simple schema and the purpose is to make sure users can type their "exercise progress information"ï¼Œ they will be able to save the info in the database and view the info from the database.
The schema wil be: 
- User_progress(PrescriptionID,YourName,DoctorName,ExerciseName, NumberOfCompletedSets, FinishStatus) 


In order to visualize the database running on azure, I designed three simple ui interfaces. Users can "view" the database and add new data to the database without downloading code.I will add more schema to the database and at the same time "delete" and "modify" the data in the database.
