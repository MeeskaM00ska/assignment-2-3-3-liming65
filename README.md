# Assignment  Details
Click the URL below to see how the database works without downloading the code and setting up enviroment:

# Language used
- React js and Next js will be used to develop the front end
- Node js on Azure is the backend
- PostgreSQL will be the database on Azure

# Summary of decisions on database part
I am working on the database part and I am going to set up postgreSQL database on Azure, as it is the required cloud platform from our partner. For now I am just going to make a simple schema and the purpose is to make sure users can type their "exercise progress information"ï¼Œ they will be able to save the info in the database and view the info from the database.
The schema wil be: 
- User_progress(PrescriptionID,YourName,DoctorName,ExerciseName, NumberOfCompletedSets, FinishStatus)
- PrescriptionID is the key

In order to visualize the database running on azure, I designed three simple ui interfaces. Users can "view" the database and add new data to the database without downloading code.In the future I will add more schema to the database and the database will be able to "delete" and "modify" the data.
